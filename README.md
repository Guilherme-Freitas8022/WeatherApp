# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a responsive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check real-time weather information for any city worldwide. By entering a city name, users can instantly view the current temperature (including "feels like"), weather conditions (such as clear sky, clouds, or rain), humidity, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times, and the local date and time of the selected location. The project uses a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live data and presents it in a clean, modern interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. This app is ideal for learning how to work with APIs, dynamic content updates, and responsive design. Future improvements may include multi-language support, weather forecasts for upcoming days, dark mode, and a search history feature.
